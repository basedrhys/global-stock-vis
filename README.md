# global-stock-vis
Visualisation of financial stock data

## Setup
To run on your machine, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

1. Download and unzip repo
1. Navigate into the project folder - `cd project` 
2. Run `npm install` to install the required packages
3. Run `node server.js` to start up the local server
4. Go to `localhost:8080` in your browser and use the visualisation.

Note: some of the data processing scripts require Google API credentials, these are not necessary for running the program so you only need them if collecting/processing extra data.
